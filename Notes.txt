- How to run the server
-- Activate virtualenv: django-apps/env/bin/activate
-- Run server: python3 django-apps/testsite/manage.py runserver 172.16.0.101:8000


Ubuntu can't do apt-get:
- Turns out the server trying to connect to ubuntu using IPv6. The solution is to change the default on gai.conf in /etc/gai.conf and uncomment "precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100" so it will try to use only IPv4.

- pip3 install virtualenv does not installed to /usr/local/bin. So I need to "sudo pip3 install virtualenv" so it installed as root to bin folder

You have 14 unapplied migration(s). Your project may not work properly until you apply the migrations for app(s): admin, auth, contenttypes, sessions.
Run 'python manage.py migrate' to apply them.

Error: That IP address can't be assigned to.
- This means the network configuration is not be able to ping their own machine (loopback interface).

- how to push to github
-- add the file by using : "git add ."
-- check the tracked file by using "git status"
-- On the /django-apps, run git commit -m "The commit message"
-- push to master branch: git push origin master

---- git fetch origin
---- git merge origin master
-- Both command can be run using this command:
git pull origin master

Avoid putting Username/Password every single commit
-If you already have your SSH keys set up and are still getting the password prompt, make sure your repo URL is in the form
- git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
- as opposed to
-- https://github.com/username/reponame.git
- To see your repo URL, run:
- git remote show origin
-You can change the URL with git remote set-url like so:
----git remote set-url origin git+ssh://git@github.com/username/reponame.git
